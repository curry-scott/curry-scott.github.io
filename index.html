  <h2>Thoughts on Week One</h2>
   
   <p>Week one has been excitingly tough! The famous motto "Fail ofter, Fail fast and Fail forward" is a guarantee. Although failing happens often, I'm proud to say that I'm learing alot. At the end of the first week, I'm starting to produce my first blog. Over the next 15 weeks I don't know what to expect, but the expectations to learn are high. In the end of this 16 weeks of bootcamp my goal is to be prepared to enter a new career industry as a desired "Web Developer" fully qualified.</p>

 <summary><strong>Week Two</strong></summary>
 <br>
  
  <p>The second week on this journey has been a little better. I am picking up on how to use a mac and terminal, which has been very helpful. Class wise though, this week has been focused on HTML and CSS. This subject hasn't been easy learning to insert pics and vidoes, then resizing and making the layout flow readable and working correctly. There is so much more than ever imaginable to making a simple website we see every day.</p> 
  
  <p>During week two, I have still failed and failed often, but I also feel as though I am making progress to the final goal of becoming a "Web Developer". My biggest issues this week were more of the fine small details whether it be a "/" or a space for examples. Seeing other classmates having the same issues and all of us helping each other out and having our instructors "Justin" and "Ian" guiding us in the right direction is helpful, but nobody makes it easy. This class is challenging and does get me out of my comfort zone every day.</p> 

  <p>I'm excited to continue on this Awesome Inc Bootcamp journey to the end and learn as much possible to become the best person, coworker and final goal freelance web developer. I'm wanting to learn as much possible about each program languages, what they can do and what each are used for primarily to direct me of reaching my goals.</p>

  <summary><strong>Week Three</strong></summary>
  <br>
  
  <p>Getting familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascript, I am seeing why when combined together they create most of the content on the web. There is a lot of information to understand about the three and bringing them together. HTML is what provides the structure and establishes the layout of your page. CSS gives your web page aesthetic characteristics and JavaScript gives the web page interactive qualities for the users.</p><br> 

  <p>Pseudo coding!! It's a valuable tool, that you don't know that is actually need and the importance. Going through this weeks projects, I have come to understand the value of pseudo coding. This week we did a pseudo coding project, mine was over "making a cup of coffee". Never realized how many steps it takes to do such an easy task and without a plan (pseudo code) then explaing the basics steps becomes difficult. I see the value of pseudo coding and will continue doing them with all upcoming projects.</p><br>

  <summary><strong>Week Four</strong></summary>
  <br>

  <p> Week four has been a good week. A lot of learning and Javascript hasn't been the easiest subject to learn. I find everything that we are doing and going over to be very interesting and I am looking forward to coninuing this journey. </p>

<p> This week we was about the “Digital Clock” and “Countdown Timer”. Both are really cool projects and just a start on what we as developers are able to do. So far pre-work has been enjoyable, I have enjoyed the rapid learning and being able to see what you are learning.  Everything that we have learned so far have their own pros and cons. Everything has their challenge, but the possibilities are endless with what is being taught in this bootcamp. </p>

<p> This is the last week of prework and starting Monday we will be in classroom and all learning together. I’m excited for the future.</P>

  <summary><strong>Week Five</strong></summary>
  <br>

  <p> Week five and the first week of being in the class room setting. We have all learned so much already and the information just keeps pouring in. It’s been difficult to retain all the information being thrown at us each week. It’s been very enjoyable being in the classroom setting and having everybody there together to help each other out and to get more views on issues. As for week five there are a few questions.</p>

<p>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?. I would have to say it learning something new. Every week we are learning a completely new, it’s difficult to retain all the information. Although I do like being pushed I would like to get more comfortable before moving to the next new subject. </p>

<p> What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding Javascript. Javascript is something that I plan on using daily. I want to learn as much possible and become an expert within the field with using Javascript. Anything I can learn, the better it will be. </p>


<p> This is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding Bootstrap or Atomic Design? Atomic Design is an interesting view when creating or designing. An absolute great tool and way to view a process moving forward. I feel the same with Atomic Design as I do Javascript, knowing this information is only going to benefit you. As for Bootstrap, that is a very creative tool. I’m not sure my mind can really keep up with the creativity that Bootstrap allows. For those with the very creative minds, this is a huge tool that can make your business much more inviting and welcome. I will surely keep learning Bootstrap in the future. </p>

<p> As for week 5, I believe this week has been a huge success and looking forward continuing this bootcamp. </p>
