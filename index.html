  <h2>Thoughts on Week One</h2>
   
   <p>Week one has been excitingly tough! The famous motto "Fail ofter, Fail fast and Fail forward" is a guarantee. Although failing happens often, I'm proud to say that I'm learing alot. At the end of the first week, I'm starting to produce my first blog. Over the next 15 weeks I don't know what to expect, but the expectations to learn are high. In the end of this 16 weeks of bootcamp my goal is to be prepared to enter a new career industry as a desired "Web Developer" fully qualified.</p>

 <summary><strong>Week Two</strong></summary>
 <br>
  
  <p>The second week on this journey has been a little better. I am picking up on how to use a mac and terminal, which has been very helpful. Class wise though, this week has been focused on HTML and CSS. This subject hasn't been easy learning to insert pics and vidoes, then resizing and making the layout flow readable and working correctly. There is so much more than ever imaginable to making a simple website we see every day.</p> 
  
  <p>During week two, I have still failed and failed often, but I also feel as though I am making progress to the final goal of becoming a "Web Developer". My biggest issues this week were more of the fine small details whether it be a "/" or a space for examples. Seeing other classmates having the same issues and all of us helping each other out and having our instructors "Justin" and "Ian" guiding us in the right direction is helpful, but nobody makes it easy. This class is challenging and does get me out of my comfort zone every day.</p> 

  <p>I'm excited to continue on this Awesome Inc Bootcamp journey to the end and learn as much possible to become the best person, coworker and final goal freelance web developer. I'm wanting to learn as much possible about each program languages, what they can do and what each are used for primarily to direct me of reaching my goals.</p>

  <summary><strong>Week Three</strong></summary>
  <br>
  
  <p>Getting familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascript, I am seeing why when combined together they create most of the content on the web. There is a lot of information to understand about the three and bringing them together. HTML is what provides the structure and establishes the layout of your page. CSS gives your web page aesthetic characteristics and JavaScript gives the web page interactive qualities for the users.</p><br> 

  <p>Pseudo coding!! It's a valuable tool, that you don't know that is actually need and the importance. Going through this weeks projects, I have come to understand the value of pseudo coding. This week we did a pseudo coding project, mine was over "making a cup of coffee". Never realized how many steps it takes to do such an easy task and without a plan (pseudo code) then explaing the basics steps becomes difficult. I see the value of pseudo coding and will continue doing them with all upcoming projects.</p><br>
