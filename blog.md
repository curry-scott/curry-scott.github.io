### *Thoughts on Week One*
   Week one has been excitingly tough! The famous motto "Fail ofter, Fail fast and Fail forward" is a guarantee. Although failing happens often, I'm proud to say that I'm learing alot. At the end of the first week, I'm starting to produce my first blog. Over the next 15 weeks I don't know what to expect, but the expectations to learn are high. In the end of this 16 weeks of bootcamp my goal is to be prepared to enter a new career industry as a desired "Web Developer" fully qualified.

  

## *Week Two*

  The second week on this journey has been a little better. I am picking up on how to use a mac and terminal, which has been very helpful. Class wise though, this week has been focused on HTML and CSS. This subject hasn't been easy learning to insert pics and vidoes, then resizing and making the layout flow readable and working correctly. There is so much more than ever imaginable to making a simple website we see every day. 
  
  During week two, I have still failed and failed often, but I also feel as though I am making progress to the final goal of becoming a "Web Developer". My biggest issues this week were more of the fine small details whether it be a "/" or a space for examples. Seeing other classmates having the same issues and all of us helping each other out and having our instructors "Justin" and "Ian" guiding us in the right direction is helpful, but nobody makes it easy. This class is challenging and does get me out of my comfort zone every day. 

  I'm excited to continue on this Awesome Inc Bootcamp journey to the end and learn as much possible to become the best person, coworker and final goal freelance web developer. I'm wanting to learn as much possible about each program languages, what they can do and what each are used for primarily to direct me of reaching my goals.
