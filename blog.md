 ### *Objective of Week One*
- Start learning Git 
- Start a Github account
- Start a blog


### *My past 24 hours*
  - I have finished my [First Week](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/first-week-on-github)
  - I have started on this [blog](https://github.com/curry-scott/curry-scott.github.io)
           
    
### *Thoughts on Week One*
   Week one has been excitingly tough! There has and will continue being a lot of failing, but at the end of the first week I am starting to produce my first blog. Over the next 15 weeks I have high expectations to learn as much as possible and being prepared to enter a new career industry as a desired "Web Developer" fully qualified.
