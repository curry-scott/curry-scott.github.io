### *Thoughts on Week One*
   Week one has been excitingly tough! There has and will be more fails during this bootcamp, that is a sure statement. I'm proud to say that learing is a must and at the end of the first week, I'm starting to produce my first blog. Over the next 15 weeks I don't know what to expect, but the expectations to learn are high. In the end of this 16 weeks of bootcamp my goal is to be prepared to enter a new career industry as a desired "Web Developer" fully qualified.
